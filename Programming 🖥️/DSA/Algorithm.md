An algorithm is a instruction which take an `input` and produces an `output`. This output should always be the same.

For example we have an non-empty [[Array]] and we want to get the largest `number` from this array.
We take in the non-empty [[Array]] and apply out algorithm to it to find the largest number.

#### Example
1. Create a variable `maxNum` and initialise it to 0
2. Iterate over each element `num` and `nums`
3. If `num` is greater then `maxNum`, update `maxNum = num`
4. Output `maxNum`

##### Important
- Algorithms should be [[Deterministic]]. Given the same **input** should **always** return the same **output**. 
- Algorithm should be correct to be
