Arrays and strings are chained together values of the same type. A String i just an array with characters.


There a **Mutable** and **Immutable** String

## Mutable
You want to change the `1` index of an String you can do for example
```c
s = 'abc'
s[1] = 'd'
```

This way you can change the output to `'adc'`.
## Immutable

There is no way to do this in an Immutable Array of String. I this case you need to `copy`the string and edit it this way
