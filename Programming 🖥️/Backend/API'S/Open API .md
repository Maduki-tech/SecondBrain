It is a Tools, where you can ride `YAML` Code to create a Documentation for your API Specification. The Sepcification can contain:
- API Endpoint
- API Server
- API Key
- Structure of the Response
- Structure of the Request
- All response codes 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx

File is created for **Intern** and **Extern** users. You can use the Swagger editor to edit and view the API Spec you created.

## Usecase

### Consumer

They can understand what the API needs and what it will send back. This way they can work without really calling your API and still know how the Response looks like

### Code generation

You can use 3rd party tools to generate the Code you define in the Open API Spec.
The Code can be the Server itself or a client who will consume the API
